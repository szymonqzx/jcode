## Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before any deployment:

```markdown
## 🚀 Pre-Deploy Checklist

- [ ] All tests passing (adapt to your project: `npm test`, `cargo test`, `pytest`, etc.)

### Security
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets
- [ ] Environment variables documented
- [ ] Dependencies audited (adapt to your project: `npm audit`, `cargo audit`, `pip-audit`, etc.)

### Performance
- [ ] Bundle size acceptable
- [ ] No console.log statements
- [ ] Images optimized

- **Duration:** 47 seconds
- **Platform:** Vercel

### URLs
- 🌐 Production: https://app.example.com
- 📊 Dashboard: https://vercel.com/project

### What Changed
- Added user profile feature
- Fixed login bug
- Updated dependencies

### Health Check
✅ API responding (200 OK)
✅ Database connected
✅ All services healthy
```

### Failed Deploy

```markdown
## ❌ Deployment Failed

### Error
Build failed at step: [specific build step]

### Details
```
[error output]
```

### Resolution
1. Fix error in [file:line]
2. Run <build-command> locally to verify
3. Try `/deploy` again

### Rollback Available
Previous version (v1.2.2) is still active.
Run `/deploy rollback` if needed.

| Railway | `railway up` | Needs Railway CLI |
| Fly.io | `fly deploy` | Needs flyctl |
| Docker | `docker compose up -d` | For containerized apps |
| AWS | `eb deploy` | Elastic Beanstalk |
| Heroku | `git push heroku main` | For Heroku apps |
| Custom | [your deploy command] | Adapt to your platform |

## Examples

```
/deploy
/deploy check
/deploy preview
/deploy production --skip-tests
/deploy rollback
```

## When to Use
- Deploying applications to production or staging environments
- Running pre-deployment checks and validation
- Rolling back to previous versions
- Deploying to preview environments for testing

## When NOT to Use
- Local development or testing (use /preview instead)
- Non-deployment tasks (use /enhance for code changes)
- Emergency hotfixes without proper testing
- Deploying uncommitted or untested code

## Edge Case Handling
- **Deployment conflicts**: Multiple deployments in progress - queue deployments or notify user
- **Environment mismatch**: Staging config differs from production - validate config before deploy
- **Rollback failure**: Rollback doesn't work - test rollback procedure in staging first
- **Partial deployment**: Some services deploy but others fail - use canary deployments
- **Database migration failures**: Migration fails mid-deploy - use reversible migrations

## Failure Modes
- **Pre-flight check failures**: Tests or lint fails - fix issues before proceeding
- **Build failures**: Compilation or bundling fails - check logs for specific errors
- **Deployment timeout**: Deployment takes too long - set timeout and auto-rollback
- **Health check failures**: New deployment unhealthy - auto-rollback to previous version
- **Configuration errors**: Wrong environment variables - validate config schema before deploy

## Performance Considerations
- Deployment time: Optimize for fast deployments (parallel builds, caching)
- Zero-downtime: Use blue-green or canary deployments for production
- Rollback speed: Ensure rollback completes within 30 seconds
- Build artifacts: Cache dependencies to speed up builds
- CDN propagation: Account for CDN cache invalidation time

## Security Notes
- **Secrets validation**: Verify no secrets in code before deployment
- **Environment isolation**: Ensure production secrets are separate from staging
- **Access control**: Restrict deployment permissions to authorized team members
- **Audit logging**: Log all deployments with who, when, and what changed
- **Vulnerability scanning**: Run security scans before production deployment

## Guardrails
- Always run pre-flight checks before deployment
- Ensure all tests pass before production deployment
- Verify environment variables and secrets are configured
- Have rollback plan ready before production deploy
- Test in preview/staging before production
